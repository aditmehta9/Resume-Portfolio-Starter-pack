    "bio": "Hi there! I am Adit! I am currently Full Stack Software Dev Co-op at Igloo Software, and I am currently employed as Coding Tutor at the Inspiration learning centre. For Frontend development, I use ReactJS because it is easy to learn, it has a massive active community, and it accelerates the development process. I have developed many projects which use Node.JS as a backend. I like to use Node.JS because it shines in building fast, scalable network applications, offers benefits in performance, faster development, and other perks. I am an open-source enthusiast. I have contributed to many open source organizations. Some of them are Google/ShakaPlayer, AnitaB, Chapel.",
